Velocity Filter Simulation
----------------------------------------------

Program created as the final project of Scientific Computer II.
Author: Caike Crepaldi (December 2015)

This program simulates the motion of charged particles in a velocity filter.

USAGE:

The program needs 3 command line arguments:
./vfsim dt B E

Where:
dt is the time step (in seconds)
B is the magnetic field stregth in x-axis (in Tesla)
E is the electric field strength in z-axis (in V/m)

If the program is executed with an incorrect number of argument, it prints information regarding its description and usage (help). 

Also, the program needs to read data from input.dat file located in the ../run/ folder.

Use the following syntax for input.dat files:

First line: Number of particles [npar]

N-th line (N=2,...,npar+1):
Particle number [n] Vx [v_i(1)] Vy [v_i(2)] Vz [v_i(3)] Mass [m] Charge [q]

The velocity must be in m/s, the mass must be in units of electron mass and the charge must be in units of electron charge.

Example:
3
1 0 0.5 0 2 -1
2 1 1.4 0 4 -3
3 1 2 1 4.3 -5
